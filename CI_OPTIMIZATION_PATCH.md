# üöÄ CI Optimization - Ready to Apply

## Changes Summary
This patch optimizes the CI pipeline by removing coverage reporting, reducing CI time from **11+ minutes to 3-5 minutes** (60-70% faster).

## Patch File
The exact changes are available in `ci-optimization.patch`. Apply with:
```bash
git apply ci-optimization.patch
```

## Manual Changes Required
If patch application fails, apply these changes manually to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

### Change 1: Update job name and comment (lines 49-52)
**Replace:**
```yaml
  # Test suite with coverage
  test:
    name: Test & Coverage
```
**With:**
```yaml
  # Test suite
  test:
    name: Test
```

### Change 2: Remove tarpaulin from tool installation (lines 91-94)
**Replace:**
```yaml
      - name: Install cargo-nextest and cargo-tarpaulin
        uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: cargo-nextest,cargo-tarpaulin
```
**With:**
```yaml
      - name: Install cargo-nextest
        uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: cargo-nextest
```

### Change 3: Remove coverage steps entirely (lines 109-117)
**DELETE these lines completely:**
```yaml
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: cargo tarpaulin --verbose --all-features --workspace --timeout 300 --out xml
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v5
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          fail_ci_if_error: false
```

## What's Preserved
- ‚úÖ Complete test suite (cargo-nextest + doctests)
- ‚úÖ Quality checks (formatting, clippy, cargo check, documentation)
- ‚úÖ Security audits and dependency review
- ‚úÖ Benchmarks and release automation
- ‚úÖ All essential CI functionality

## What's Removed
- ‚ùå Coverage report generation (~5-8 minutes saved)
- ‚ùå Codecov upload and processing
- ‚ùå cargo-tarpaulin installation

## Performance Impact
- **Before**: ~11+ minutes total CI time
- **After**: ~3-5 minutes total CI time
- **Improvement**: 60-70% faster PR feedback

## Local Coverage Alternative
Coverage can still be generated locally when needed:
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --verbose --all-features --workspace --timeout 300 --out html
open tarpaulin-report.html
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Apply the patch or make manual changes above
2. Commit with: `git commit -m "perf: optimize CI by removing coverage reporting"`
3. Test with a PR to verify ~3-5 minute CI time
4. Monitor stability over several PRs

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the changes can be easily reverted by re-adding the removed sections.
